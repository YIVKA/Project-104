           <h2>About Me</h2>
           <h3>Main Information</h3>
          <p>Hi, my name is Krish Indrasenan. I am the author and coder of
           this website. I am in 6th grade which means I am 11 years old.
           I am 5 foot 5 inches which makes me the tallest person in my 
           class.
          </p>
           <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
          <p>I have quite a few hobbies. First of all, I love to do math. 
          My favourite thing to do in math is algebra. Algebra is where you
          have to find what the value of a symbol is with equations to help solve
          it. My other hobbies are sports. I love to play sports such as basketball,
          soccer, baseball, cricket, table tennis, badminton, golf, air hockey, tennis,
          and football. Today, I got into my school football team! I attended all three 
          tryouts which had running, catching, and throwing drills so my coach can see 
          our potential.
